Contribution Note :

In this project, We contributed to the implementation of the MyTriangle and MyPoint classes. Below are the key aspects of my contribution:

1. **MyTriangle Class:**
    - We designed and implemented the MyTriangle class according to the provided class diagram.
    - Created three private instance variables `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` to represent the vertices of the triangle using instances of the MyPoint class.
    - Implemented constructors to initialize a MyTriangle object with either sets of coordinates or instances of MyPoint.
    - Developed a toString() method to provide a string description of the MyTriangle instance in the specified format.
    - Implemented a getPerimeter() method to calculate and return the perimeter of the triangle using the distance() method of MyPoint.
    - Created a printType() method to classify the triangle as "equilateral", "isosceles", or "scalene" based on its side lengths.

2. **TestMyTriangle Driver Class:**
    - Developed a test driver class called TestMyTriangle to thoroughly test all the public methods defined in the MyTriangle class.
    - Designed test cases to verify the correctness and robustness of each method.
    - Ensured that edge cases and boundary conditions were adequately covered in the testing process.

Our contributions to these classes aim to enhance the functionality and reliability of the project, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements and delivers accurate results.
