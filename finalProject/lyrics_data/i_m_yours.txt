Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it. I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted. I fell right through the cracks. Now I'm trying to get back. Before the cool done run out. I'll be giving it my bestest. And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention. I reckon it's again my turn. To win some or learn some. But I won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. Hmm (hey, hey). Well, open up your mind and see like me. Open up your plans and, damn, you're free. Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love. Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing. We're just one big family. And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved. So I won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm sure. There's no need to complicate. Our time is short. This is our fate, I'm yours.
